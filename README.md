# Windows Infrastructure Automation Suite

This project is a modular PowerShell toolkit designed to automate and standardize key tasks across a Windows-based infrastructure.

## üöÄ Core Features

- Server Inventory (hostname, OS, patch level, uptime, etc.)
- Service Monitoring (stopped/failed services on remote machines)
- GPO Analysis (unlinked/conflicting policies)
- Local Admin Audit (list users with local admin rights)
- Patch Status Reports
- Event Log Collection & Filtering

Each script is built with:
- Modular functions
- Logging and dry-run support
- Clean and readable output (CSV or HTML)
